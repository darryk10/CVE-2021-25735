##Exploit CVE-2021-25735: Kubernetes Validating Admission Webhook Bypass

###Set the Vulnerable Environment
To deploy the admission controller you need to build the Docker container image locally, tag, and push the image to Dockerhub using the below commands.
` docker build -t validationWebhook:1.0 .
 docker tag validationWebhook:1.0 darryk/dev:1.0
 docker push darryk/dev:1.0`

Now you can deploy the created image with the Node.js application into your K8s cluster. The webhook-deploy.yaml will deploy all the needed components in your cluster.
> kubectl apply -f webhook-deploy.yaml

Itâ€™s time now to register our webhook with Kubernetes API Server. To do that we create a Base64 encoded version of the ca.crt file created before and replace the CA_BUNDLE placeholder within the webhook-registration.yaml with it.
> cat ca.crt | base64

Finally, we will register the webhook with the Kubernetes API Server.
> kubectl apply -f webhook-registration.yaml
