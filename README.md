## Exploit CVE-2021-25735: Kubernetes Validating Admission Webhook Bypass

### Set the Vulnerable Environment

Let's start with running the script gencerts.sh to generate TLS certificates and keys. \
` bash gencerts.sh`

To deploy the admission controller you need to build the Docker container image locally, tag, and push the image to your Dockerhub using the below commands. \

`docker login`
`docker build -t validationWebhook:1.0 .` \
`docker tag validationWebhook:1.0 darryk/dev:1.0` \
`docker push darryk/dev:1.0`

Now you can deploy the created image with the Node.js application into your K8s cluster. The webhook-deploy.yaml will deploy all the needed components in your cluster. \
`kubectl apply -f webhook-deploy.yaml`

Let's now register our webhook with Kubernetes API Server. To do that, we create a Base64 of the ca.crt file created before and replace the CA_BUNDLE inside webhook-registration.yaml. \
`cat ca.crt | base64`

Finally, we will register the webhook with the Kubernetes API Server. \
`kubectl apply -f webhook-registration.yaml`
